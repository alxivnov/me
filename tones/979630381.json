  "description":"Previously to install your own melody as a ringtone you had to read long tutorials but Ringtonic breaks the rules. ● easy creation of unique tones from any song, ● crowdsourced slices of popular songs, ● installation tutorial for iPhone and iPad. Convert any song from your Music Library into a tone in a couple taps. Or don't tap that much, just select one of hundreds slices created by other users. Change ringtone by selecting a new popular slice every day."
